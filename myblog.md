# My Experience at GDG WOW Pune 2025

## A Journey of Inspiration and Learning

### Introduction

Last weekend, I had the incredible opportunity to attend the GDG WOW (Women of Wonders) event in Pune. As someone passionate about technology and community building, this experience exceeded all my expectations and left me feeling inspired, motivated, and connected to an amazing network of tech enthusiasts.

### The Venue and Atmosphere

The event was held at the modern tech hub in the heart of Pune. From the moment I walked in, the energy was palpable. The venue was thoughtfully decorated with Google colors, and the organization was impeccable. Registration was smooth, and the welcome kit included some cool Google Developer swag that made me feel part of something special right away.

### Opening Keynote

The day began with an inspiring keynote by Priya Sharma, a Senior Engineering Manager at Google. Her journey from a small town in Maharashtra to leading teams at Google was nothing short of inspirational. She spoke about breaking barriers, the importance of community, and how diversity drives innovation. Her words resonated with me: "Technology is powerful, but technology with diverse perspectives is transformative."

### Technical Sessions

The technical tracks were divided into three categories:
1. **Web Development Excellence**
   - The session on "Building Progressive Web Apps for Performance" offered practical insights into optimizing web applications.
   - I particularly enjoyed the hands-on workshop where we implemented service workers to create offline functionality.

2. **Cloud and Machine Learning**
   - The "Introduction to Google Cloud Platform" session demystified cloud services and provided a great foundation.
   - The ML workshop showcased how to implement basic image recognition using TensorFlow.js without needing deep ML expertise.

3. **Career Development**
   - The panel discussion "Navigating Tech Careers" featured women leaders from various tech companies sharing their experiences and advice.
   - The resume review and mock interview sessions provided personalized feedback that I'll definitely incorporate.

### Networking Opportunities

Perhaps the most valuable part of the event was connecting with like-minded individuals. During lunch and coffee breaks, I met incredible women from various backgrounds - students eager to begin their tech journey, experienced professionals willing to mentor, and entrepreneurs with innovative ideas.

I exchanged contact information with several attendees, and we've already created a WhatsApp group to continue our discussions and support each other's growth.

### Hackathon Experience

The mini-hackathon was exhilarating! Teams had four hours to develop solutions addressing community challenges. My team worked on an accessibility app that helps navigate public spaces for people with mobility challenges. Though we didn't win, the collaboration experience and feedback from judges were invaluable.

### Closing Thoughts

As the event came to a close with a fireside chat featuring successful women entrepreneurs, I reflected on everything I had learned and the connections I had made. The GDG WOW event wasn't just about technical knowledge - it was about building confidence, finding mentors, and being part of a supportive community.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Community is crucial**: Having a supportive network can make all the difference in your tech journey.
2. **Continuous learning**: Technology evolves rapidly, and staying curious is essential.
3. **Pay it forward**: As we grow, it's important to help others along their journey.
4. **Diversity matters**: Different perspectives lead to better solutions and more innovative products.

### What's Next?

Inspired by the event, I've signed up to be a volunteer for future GDG meetups in Pune. I'm also planning to work on a side project implementing some of the concepts I learned during the technical sessions.

The GDG WOW event has truly been a catalyst for both my professional growth and personal development. I'm grateful for the opportunity to be part of such an empowering community, and I look forward to many more such experiences.
